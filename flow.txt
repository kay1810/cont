**Detailed Workflow: Automated Certificate Renewal**

1. **Start:**
   - The process begins.

2. **JSON Datastore Creation:**
   - Certificate-related data is collected from various sources, including CSV files and manual inputs.
   - Data is formatted into a JSON structure containing server information, certificate names, and expiry dates.
   - Validation:
     - Check if the JSON datastore is valid.
     - Error Handling:
       - If the JSON datastore is invalid, display an error message and halt the process.

3. **Certificate Validation:**
   - A script reads the JSON datastore to retrieve certificate information.
   - Validation:
     - Check if Venafi credentials are provided.
     - Error Handling:
       - If Venafi credentials are missing, display an error message and halt the process.

4. **Check Certificates Nearing Expiry:**
   - Examine the expiry dates of certificates to identify those nearing expiry, typically within 30 days.
   - Validation:
     - Check if the Venafi API is accessible.
     - Error Handling:
       - If unable to access the Venafi API, display an error message and halt the process.

5. **Retrieve Certificate Status from Venafi API:**
   - Access the Venafi API using provided credentials to retrieve certificates' status and expiry dates.
   - Validation:
     - Check if certificates are retrieved successfully.
     - Error Handling:
       - If unable to retrieve certificates, display an error message and halt the process.

6. **Identify Certificates Needing Renewal:**
   - Compare the expiry dates obtained from Venafi with the current date to determine certificates needing renewal.
   - Validation:
     - Check if any certificates need renewal.
     - Error Handling:
       - If no certificates need renewal, proceed to certificate installation.
       - If unable to identify certificates needing renewal, display an error message and halt the process.

7. **Octopus Deployment:**
   - Initiate Octopus deployments for certificates nearing expiry, ensuring efficient renewal planning.
   - Docker containers execute Python scripts to interact with the Venafi API for certificate renewal.
   - Validation:
     - Ensure successful initiation of Octopus deployments.
     - Error Handling:
       - If Octopus deployments fail to initiate, display an error message and halt the process.

8. **Docker Container Execution (Venafi Certificate Renewal):**
   - Execute Python scripts within Docker containers to access the Venafi renew endpoint and renew certificates nearing expiry.
   - Validation:
     - Ensure successful execution of the renewal process.
     - Error Handling:
       - If certificate renewal fails, display an error message and halt the process.

9. **PowerShell Certificate Installation:**
   - PowerShell scripts receive renewed certificate's PFX content, certificate name, and server name as inputs.
   - Install renewed certificates on the target servers.
   - Validation:
     - Ensure successful installation of renewed certificates.
     - Error Handling:
       - If certificate installation fails, display an error message and halt the process.

10. **Logging and Monitoring:**
    - Log installation statuses, including success or failure, to a designated location for tracking and monitoring purposes.

11. **Display Logs on GitHub Pages:**
    - Logs are displayed on GitHub Pages for easy access and monitoring.

12. **End:**
    - The process concludes.
