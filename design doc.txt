### 3. Executive Summary
- Overview of the project
- Objective: Automate certificate renewal process for servers to ensure uninterrupted service and security.
- Scope: Develop scripts to handle certificate renewal, server identification, Octopus deployment, and update server information.
- Key Features: Daily certificate expiration check, automated renewal using Venafi API, Octopus deployment for certificate installation, update of server information, logging of installation status.

### 4. Introduction
- Background: Explanation of the need for automated certificate renewal to prevent service disruptions and maintain security.
- Purpose of the Document: To outline the detailed design of the automated solution for certificate renewal.
- Scope of the Project: Covers the development of scripts to handle certificate renewal and server updates.

### 5. Requirements Analysis
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Certificate Expiration Check:
    - Script to check expiry dates of certificates in CSV file.
    - Identify certificates with expiry less than 30 days.
  - Certificate Renewal:
    - Script to connect to IDP and Venafi API for authentication.
    - Fetch bearer token and renew certificates using Venafi API.
    - Update CSV file with renewal status and new expiry date.
  - Server Identification for Renewal:
    - Script to identify servers using the renewed certificates.
    - Mark servers for renewal and trigger Octopus deployment.
  - Octopus Deployment:
    - Script to create deployment for installing renewed certificates.
    - Different steps based on certificate installation type (IIS, Java Keystore, MMC).
  - Certificate Installation:
    - PowerShell script to install renewed certificates on servers.
    - Retrieve renewed certificates from Venafi.
    - Perform TVT checks after installation.
  - Logging and Update:
    - Log installation status in separate file in Git.
    - Update server CSV file with installation status.

- **Non-functional Requirements**:
  - Security: Ensure secure communication with IDP and Venafi API.
  - Reliability: Scripts should handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate logging.
  - Performance: Scripts should execute efficiently without causing significant overhead.
  - Scalability: Able to handle a large number of servers and certificates.
