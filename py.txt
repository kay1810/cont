Title: Enhancing Operational Efficiency through SRE Automation

Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Today, I'm here to share how our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team has been enhancing our operational efficiency through automation. In the next three minutes, I'll walk you through the significant tasks we've automated and the impact they've had on our daily operations.

1. **Automated Health Checks with TeamCity:**
   Previously, the team spent an hour each day manually checking the status of application servers and sending reports. With our automated health checks integrated into TeamCity, this process has been streamlined. Our script now hits all relevant endpoints and sends comprehensive reports to our common team channel. Additionally, these health checks are scheduled to run automatically after server patching, eliminating the need for manual intervention and ensuring continuous monitoring of server health.

2. **Automated Patching via Tanium:**
   Manual intervention in patching processes is now a thing of the past for us. Through automation with Tanium, patching tasks are seamlessly executed without any manual steps required at any stage. This not only saves time but also enhances the reliability and consistency of our patching procedures.

3. **Automated SSL Certificate Renewal:**
   We're currently in the process of implementing automated SSL certificate renewal. This initiative will significantly reduce the need for manual intervention in certificate renewal tasks for each server. By automating this process, we ensure timely renewal without the risk of overlooking any certificates, thereby enhancing security and reliability.

4. **Automated AD Account Password Checks:**
   Maintaining the security of our Active Directory (AD) accounts is crucial. Our SRE team has developed a script to regularly check the status of service accounts, including password expiration, lockout, or expiry. If any issues are detected, relevant stakeholders are promptly notified via email. Furthermore, we have automated daily builds to ensure continuous monitoring of account security, minimizing the risk of security breaches due to overlooked password issues.

In conclusion, these automation initiatives by our SRE team have not only saved valuable time and effort but have also significantly enhanced the reliability, security, and efficiency of our operations. By leveraging automation tools and scripts, we are able to focus our efforts on more strategic tasks, driving innovation and delivering exceptional service to our customers.
